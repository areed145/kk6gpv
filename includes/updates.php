Coconut Barometer KCABAKER38 has signed off (I have moved homes), concluding 3+ years of contribution to WU.<br>
Only a handful of reporting stations have been active longer in the Bakersfield area.<br>
Data shown on this site is now from the longstanding KCABAKER64 at Pflugh Farms and development of this site's infrastructure will continue while Coconut Barometer seeks a new home!
