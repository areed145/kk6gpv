    <p>In early 2017 a buddy and I bought N5777V, a 1966 Beechcraft Musketeer Super III. It has a 200hp IO-360 and nearly 1000# useful load, and does 120kts at around 9gph. Our requirements were 4 seats, and the ability to carry 4 normal humans with full fuel. Many 4 seat aircraft you must take less fuel to actually carry 4 passengers. We had been looking mainly at Piper Cherokees and preferred low-wings, so when the fixed-pitch, fixed-gear, priced-right Super Mouse showed up nearby we went to give it a look over.</p>

    <p>Later in 2017 the plane was borrowed for use in a Netflix movie, and some aerial filming was done from a helicopter. No idea when the movie will be realeased though</p>
